# 💫 LuxeVastra – My First Step into Web Development

Welcome to **LuxeVastra**, a beginner-friendly eCommerce fashion website created as part of my learning journey. This is my **first hands-on web development project**, built during my second year of B.Tech CSE.

## 👗 About the Project

**LuxeVastra** is a conceptual luxury clothing brand website that blends clean UI design with cultural essence. The name combines:

- **"Luxe"** – symbolizing elegance and modern fashion  
- **"Vastra"** – a Hindi word meaning *clothes*, reflecting Indian roots

The website presents a polished homepage featuring:

- Stylish promotional banners  
- Navigation menus  
- A sleek and responsive layout  
- Modern font and color choices

## 🔧 Tech Stack

This project is built using **pure front-end technologies**:

- 🧱 **HTML** – for page structure  
- 🎨 **CSS** – for layout and styling  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – basic mobile-friendly structure (media queries)

> No frameworks or libraries were used — just handwritten, beginner-level code.
